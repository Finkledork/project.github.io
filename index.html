                                                  In 2008, the first publicly availiable draft was released by the Web Hypertext Applocation Technology Working Group (WHATWG),                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                  but in 2014, HTML5 was properly released. HTML5 was compatable with webrowsers such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Safari,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
    Firefox and Opera. Overtime, people mastered the launguage and created websites that has surpased the limits of what could be achieved through coding. HTML5 is still being taught in schools today due to its reliablilty and its easy to learn code

With HTML the only thing stopping you is your imagination.
You can create a button that creates more buttons, have text
move from one side of the screen to the other, and you can even
create other pages that are still linked to the site!
